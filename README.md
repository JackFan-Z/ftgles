# FTGLES 0.2.1

FTGLES is a C++ library for rendering fonts on mobile operating systems with OpenGL ES 1.1.  It is a port of [FTGL](http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/henryj/code/#FTGL).  It currently targets the iPhone and iPad, with plans to port to Android in the very near future.  iOS 4 is currently supported.

From the FTGL notes:

"Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data into a lesser quality, proprietary format."

"FTGL uses the [Freetype](http://www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode' the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient for OpenGL rendering."


## INSTALL

See [INSTALL NOTES](http://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to add FTGLES to your Xcode project or build using automake.


## USAGE

Include the library in your code:
	
	#include "FTGL/ftgles.h"

Create a font from a truetype file or opentype font:
	
	FTFont *font = new FTTextureFont("/path/to/myfont.ttf");
	FTFont *font2 = new FTTextureFont("/path/to/myotherfont.otf");
	font->FaceSize(72);
	
To render the text within your render loop (fonts are rendered at the origin along the positive x-axis):

	glColor4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // Black text
	font->Render("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet");

The [Hello World Demo](http://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/blob/master/Demos/iOS/HelloWorld/Classes/Delegate.mm) example class shows a minimal implementation of a render loop.

See the [Demos](http://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/tree/master/iPhone/) folder for several comprehensive sample iPhone apps.  The demo apps include a unicode demo, as well as a demonstration of how to use layouts to easily align and position your text.


## Differences between FTGL and FTGLES

FTGLES 0.1 supports the following font types from the original FTGL library:

 - FTBufferFont
 - FTGLOutlineFont
 - FTGLPolygonFont
 - FTGLTextureFont

Extrusion and pixmap rendering from the original FTGL library are currently not supported.  Bitmap font support is currently in progress.

Open GL ES 2 support is coming soon.


## Performance

It is recommended that you avoid excessive use of Polygon fonts in iOS applications until render speeds have been improved.

Performance of the SimpleLayout class was previously very slow, but was recently improved in a recent build.  

There is a [Performance test application](https://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/tree/master/Demos/iOS/PerformanceTest/) that will show the framerate of a screen full of text rendered using the SimpleLayout class, along with several font faces.
