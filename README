FTGLES 0.8
===========

FTGLES is a C++ library for rendering fonts on mobile operating systems with 
OpenGL ES 1.1. It is a port of FTGL. Its primary target is the iPhone.

From the FTGL notes:

"Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats
so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data
into a lesser quality, proprietary format."

"FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient
for OpenGL rendering."

FTGLES 0.1 supports the following font types from the original FTGL library:
	* FTBufferFont
	* FTGLOutlineFont
	* FTGLPolygonFont
	* FTGLTextureFont

Extrusion and pixmap rendering from the original FTGL library are currently 
not supported. Bitmap font support is currently in progress.

Open GL ES 2 support coming soon.

===========
USAGE:

Include the library in your code:
	
	#include "FTGL/ftgles.h"

Create a font from a truetype file or opentype font:
	
	FTFont *font = new FTTextureFont("myfont.ttf");
	FTFont *font2 = new FTTextureFont("myotherfont.otf");
	font->FaceSize(72);
	
Render text within your render loop:

	font->Render("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet");

See iPhone/demo for an in-depth example that can run on an iPhone, including
an example of using layouts to easily align and position your text.
